# AI Math Helper - Project Overview

## Project Description
A personalized web application designed to help Ethan and Daniel improve their math skills in specific areas where they struggle, based on their recent assessments.

## Target Users
- **Ethan** (Elder son): Year 6, Age 11 (UK)
- **Daniel** (Younger son): Year 4, Age 9 (UK)

Both children are towards the end of their academic year.

## Learning Areas

### Ethan's Struggling Areas
1. **Time Tables & Time Zones** - Solving problems using timetables or time zones
2. **Speed, Distance & Time** - Using relationships between speed, distance and time
3. **Rounding Estimation** - Using rounding to estimate answers
4. **Decimal Problem Solving** - Understanding decimals to solve numerical problems

### Daniel's Struggling Areas
1. **Thermometer Scale Reading** - Understanding scales in 2's, 5's, 10's, or negatives
2. **Time Fraction Interpretation** - Interpreting fractions of seconds, minutes or hours
3. **Multiplication/Division by 10s** - Multiplying and dividing numbers, including decimals, by multiples of 10
